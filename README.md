HOW TO PLAY SKYFIRE:
First, you are supposed to free all hostages in the 4 villages.
Only then, you can go to the fortress and defeat THE NECROMANCER.

In battles, you and your opponent choose 1 out of 3 spells to defeat the other.
The DEFENSE spell beats the ATTACK spell.
The ATTACK spell beats the CONFUSE spell.
The CONFUSE spell beats the DEFENSE spell.
If you both pick the same spell, the person with the higher LEVEL wins.
If one of you has a very high LEVEL, they could win the round even if you pick the wrong spell.
As you win battles, your LEVEL increases.
If you lose battles, your HEALTH decreases.

In every village, you can roll the DICE OF DESTINY, which could increase or decrease your LEVEL.
The minimum LEVEL you can have is 10 and the maximum LEVEL you can have is 120.
You can only run the DICE OF DESTINY 3 times in each village.

If your HEALTH reaches 0, GAME OVER!

Good Luck and Have Fun saving SKYFIRE!
